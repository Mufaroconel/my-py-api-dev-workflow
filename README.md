### **Approach Overview**

This FastAPI project follows a modular approach to structure the backend of a Real Estate application. The application is divided into separate modules (routers, models, schemas, CRUD operations, and database setup) to manage various resources, such as users, properties, reservations, and verification requests.

### **Project Structure**

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

│   └── database.py          # Database connection and setup
├── models/                  # SQLAlchemy models
│   ├── user.py              # User model
│   ├── property.py          # Property model
│   └── ...                  # Other models (media, verification_request, etc.)
├── routers/                 # FastAPI routers

│   ├── user.py              # User-related routes
│   ├── property.py          # Property-related routes
│   └── ...                  # Other route files (reservation, verification_request, etc.)
├── schemas/                 # Pydantic schemas

├── crud/                    # CRUD operations

```

### **Main Application (`main.py`)**

The `main.py` file is the entry point for the FastAPI application. It serves as the main configuration file, where routes are included, and the FastAPI application instance is created.

#### **Key Functions in `main.py`:**

1. **FastAPI Instance**: The application instance is created using `FastAPI()`, which initializes the backend server.

   ```python
   app = FastAPI()
   ```

2. **Include Routers**: Each module or resource has its own router (e.g., `user`, `property`, `reservation`), which is included in the main app to handle requests related to these entities.

   ```python
   app.include_router(auth.router)
   app.include_router(user_router.router)
   app.include_router(verification_request_api.router, prefix="/landlord", tags=["Landlord Verification"])
   app.include_router(property_router.router)
   app.include_router(reservation_router.router)
   ```

   Each router is associated with a specific URL path and tag for better organization. For example:

   * **Authentication**: `auth.router`
   * **Users**: `user_router.router`
   * **Landlord Verification**: `verification_request_api.router` with a prefix `/landlord`
   * **Properties**: `property_router.router`
   * **Reservations**: `reservation_router.router`

3. **Root Endpoint**: The root endpoint provides a simple message to verify that the backend is running.

   ```python
   @app.get("/")
   def root():
       return {"msg": "Real Estate App Backend - Landlord Onboarding"}
   ```

### **How Routes are Managed**

The project is divided into distinct modules for each resource:

#### **1. Models**:

* **Purpose**: Define the structure of the data stored in the database.
* **Example**: `models/user.py` defines the `User` model with columns such as `id`, `name`, `email`, etc.

#### **2. Schemas**:

* **Purpose**: Define how data is validated and serialized using Pydantic models.
* **Example**: `schemas/user.py` defines schemas like `UserCreate`, `UserUpdate`, and `UserResponse`.

#### **3. CRUD Operations**:

* **Purpose**: Handle database queries and operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
* **Example**: `crud/user.py` defines functions like `get_user_by_id`, `create_user`, `update_user`, and `delete_user`.

#### **4. Routes**:

* **Purpose**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and link them to the appropriate CRUD functions and schemas.
* **Example**: `routers/user.py` defines routes like `GET /users/{user_id}`, `POST /users/`, `PUT /users/{user_id}`, and `DELETE /users/{user_id}`.

### **How to Extend This Project**

To add a new resource (e.g., `Property`, `Reservation`):

1. **Model**: Create a new model in the `models/` directory (e.g., `models/property.py`).
2. **Schema**: Define corresponding schemas in the `schemas/` directory.
3. **CRUD**: Implement the CRUD operations in the `crud/` directory (e.g., `crud/property.py`).
4. **Router**: Define the API routes in the `routers/` directory (e.g., `routers/property.py`).
5. **Include Router**: Include the new router in the `main.py` file.

Example for adding a new route for properties:

* Create a `Property` model.
* Create a `PropertyCreate` and `PropertyResponse` schema.
* Create CRUD operations for managing properties.
* Define new routes in `routers/property.py` to handle requests related to properties.

---

### **Security Considerations**

* **Password Hashing**: Ensure passwords are hashed securely (e.g., using `bcrypt`) before storing them in the database.
* **Authentication**: The `auth.py` router should handle user authentication (e.g., using JWT tokens) for protected routes.

---

### **Testing and Documentation**

Once routes are defined:

1. **Testing**: Test the endpoints using Postman or any API testing tool. Verify the functionality of all CRUD operations and edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, unauthorized access).
2. **API Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc, available at `/docs` and `/redoc` respectively. This allows easy testing and exploration of the API directly from the browser.
